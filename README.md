# Clinic Management System - Lung Disease & Cancer Diagnosis

![Project Overview](Clinic-Mangment/media/images/Atelectasis.png)

A smart medical system backend built with Django REST Framework for detecting lung diseases and cancer stages using Deep Learning and Fuzzy Logic. Designed for doctors, patients, and secretariat.

## üìã Use Cases

### üë®‚öïÔ∏è For Doctors
- Diagnose 13 lung diseases from chest X-rays using a deep-learning model.  
- Predict lung cancer stages via fuzzy logic based on 9 symptom inputs.  
- View patient history and treatment archives.  

### üë§ For Patients
- Book appointments online.  
- Access diagnostic reports and treatment plans. 
- Diagnose a cancer and treatment if there.

### üñ•Ô∏è For Secertary
- Patient Appointment Management
- View patient files View and organize appointment schedules
- Managing working hours

## ü§ñ AI Components

### 1. Deep Learning Model (Multi-Class Lung Disease Detection)
- **Architecture:** ResNet-50  
- **Dataset:** 120,000 radiological images  
- **Classes:** 13 diseases (Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Edema, etc.)

!!! **NOTICE**:
    NEED TO DOWNLOAD WIEGHT OF MODEL, WE REMOVE THE WIEGHTS FOR SIZE OF PROJECT.

**Usage**:
```python
from lung_ai.Deep_Learing.LungModel import load_model

model = load_model('lung_ai/Deep_Learing/best_mlc_resnet50.pt')
prediction = model.predict(image_path)
```

### 2. Fuzzy Logic System (Cancer Stage Prediction)
This model contains several errors resulting from the research paper that we relied on, so DO NOT ADOPT IT AS A REFERENCE.
- **Inputs**: 9 variables (e.g., Age, Smoking)
   - the input variable should be numeric value consistent with the values specified in the Fuzzy Logic moodle code.

- **Output**: Disease progression stage (I‚ÄìIV) and treatment recommendation.
